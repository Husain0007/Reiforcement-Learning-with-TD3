# Reiforcement Learning with TD3

 The *Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients Algorithm* or TD3 for short, is an extension of traditional Deep Q-Learning which is religated to a discrete action space.  
 The TD3 algorithm was conceived by the research team at Google Deep Mind ([here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971))  
 
In this project, I will be implementing the TD3 algorithm using PyTorch to train a Quadruped to run across a field generated in the [pybullet](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/) enviornment.
